The triggers:

ucm_block_activity.pl   
ucm_block_devstream.pl  
ucm_complete_delivery.pl
ucm_check_targets.pl    
ucm_serial_delivery.pl


Are all originally created by David Baird and copied from:
http://www.cmcrossroads.com/cgi-bin/cmwiki/view/CM/ClearCaseUnifiedChangeManagementTriggers

We have used these triggers as inspiration at several customer, we have altered them slightly or completely but conceptually they have been doing the same thing every time.

Even though we plan to alter them again in the Accelerated ClearCase project (http://launchpad.net/acc)
We have included them here in their originally versions as a tribute to David Baird.
