<p>view_q.pl - View Quarantine Utilities</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p>A collection of features that enables quarantine, purge and recover of views based on
the view's 'last accessed' date.</p>
<p>Execute the script with -help switch to learn the syntax and usage.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>A fundamental concept to understand when working with view_q.pl is &quot;Stranded views&quot;.</p>
<p>Stranded views are views that have valid (and registered) view storages, but haven't got any
view tags in any region.</p>
<p>Stranded views are unavailable for use, but can easily be brought back to availability by using:</p>
<pre>
  cleartool mktag -view ...</pre>
<p>Clearcase has a feature called rgy_check (which is only available on ClearCase registry servers
though!). Rgy_check utility can report stranded views.</p>
<pre>
  rgy_check -views</pre>
<p>Run cleartool man rgy_check to learn more.</p>
<p>When view_q.pl puts a view into quarantine, it removes all tags in all regions. This puts the
view into the state of being 'stranded'. An important difference between 'regular&quot; stranded
and views put into quarantine by view_q.pl is the file called</p>
<pre>
  .view_quarantine</pre>
<p>which view_q.pl created in the in the 'admin' subfolder in the view storage. This file contains the history
of tags in all regions from where they were deleted. and enables a complete restore of which can be done from
any machine with ClearCase installed.</p>
<p>View_q.pl can be run in a mode where it lists all views not accessed since a certain date. if you whish you
can even tell view_q.pl to automatically put these views into quarantine.</p>
<p>View_q.pl has a different mode which lists all views that are currently in quarantine (As you may have figured
out this is partly determined by the fact that views are stranded, so this mode only works when executed from
the ClearCase Registry server, which support rgy_check!)</p>
<p>When listing the quarantined views you can either automatically purge or recover the views.</p>
<p>Views can also be purged or recovered individually.</p>
<p>When view_q.pl purges a view it simply re-creates an intermediate view tag and runs a regular</p>
<pre>
  cleartool remove view</pre>
<p>When a view is recovered by view_q.pl it simply restores all tags in all the regions where it was removed from.</p>
<p>Some views aren't supposed to be deleted even when they haven't been accessed for a long time. View_q.pl can
be instructed to disable quarantine of these views.</p>

<h2><a name="internal_subfunctions">Internal subfunctions</a></h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="validate_options___">validate_options( )</a></h3>
<p>The sub-functions read the options and switches applied with the execution into
the global variables that are defined to cache them.</p>
<p>The function will kill the script execution if unknown switches are used.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<pre>
  none</pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre>
  nothing</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="enable_log___">enable_log( )</a></h3>
<pre>

The sub-function overwrites the default settings for log, debug and verbose if set manually and enables the functionality in the logger.
Prefix option name with &quot;no&quot; for force disable (e.g. -nodebug)</pre>
<p>Debug:
- enables verbose, unless -noverbose is set in the script call.
- enables the logfile
- gives some extra logging information (variable values, additional information, ect.)</p>
<p>Verbose:
- enables log to STDOUT</p>
<p>Logfile:
- enables the logfile
- sets the logfilename (and path) if specified
- the environment variables SCRIPTLOG_ENABLED or CLEARCASE_TRIGGER_DEBUG forces the logfile to enable, not matter what</p>
<p>Checks for ARGV arguments (unreferenced values):
- if log is enabled, it dies if there is more then one (expect it to be filename or relative/absolute path AND filename)
- if log is disabled, it dies if there are any
- The logger module fails, if the specified log, can't be opened/created</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<pre>
  Non
  Uses -verbose, -debug and -logfile</pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre>
  nothing (unless it dies)</pre>
<p>exit:</p>
<pre>
  Will kill the script exit 1 (die) on ARGV errors - printing the arguments</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="xxx_mode___">xxx_mode( )</a></h3>
<p>The sub-functions named xxx_mode all work as switches.</p>
<p>They all start by checking the options and switches applied with the execution to see if the have any work
to do. if so, they take full responsibility over the remainder of the script execution and exits the script
with either 1 or 0;</p>
<pre>

Parameters:</pre>
<pre>
  none</pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre>
  nothing</pre>
<p>exit:</p>
<p>Will force the entire script to exit with 0 or 1</p>
<pre>
  1  =   Wrong set of switches applied
  0  =   Successful execution</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="lsquarantined___">lsquarantined( )</a></h3>
<p>NOTE: This function will only run on ClearCase registry servers!!!</p>
<p>This function lists all the quarantined views.</p>
<p>The format of the listing is the local view storage (as reported by lsview -age).</p>
<p>A quarantined view is defined as a view that is reported &quot;stranded&quot; by rgy_check and which has
a .view_quarantine file in the admin directory of the storage.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<pre>
  none</pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre>
  @result    =    The list of quarantined storages.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="purge_stg___stg__">purge_stg( $stg )</a></h3>
<p>This function purges a view storage.</p>
<p>It will recreate one intermediate tag to the view stg and then do a regular
(safe) view removal.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<pre>
  $stg   = The storage to purge (the global one, as reported by a lsview command, or
           simply the local-path as reported by rgy_check)</pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre>
  1    =    Success
  0    =    The $stg does not contain a .view_quarantine file or the $stg contains
            a .view_q_ignore file.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="quarantine_stg___stg__">quarantine_stg( $stg )</a></h3>
<p>This function quarantines a view storage.</p>
<p>It will untag tags in all regions and record the reverse commands (the corresponding
mktag commands) in a file named .view_quarantine located in the admin directory of the
view storage.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<pre>
  $stg   = The storage to quarantine (the global one, as reported by a lsview command)</pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre>
  1    =    Success
  0    =    The $stg parameter is invalid - nothing to do!</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="vwsstgs_nasince___cut_date____result__">vwsstgs_nasince( $cut_date, \@result )</a></h3>
<p>This function pushes (global) view storage locations onto the result array
handed into the sub as a reference if they haven't been accessed since $cut_date.</p>
<p>The format of the resulting list entries are like this:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;YYYY-MM-DD&gt; &lt;view_stg&gt;</pre>
<p>Where  view &lt;YYYY-MM-DD&gt; is the last accessed date, and &lt;view_stg&gt; is the global view storage location.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<pre>
  $cut_date      =  The date to compare against. The scalar must be in the format YYYY-DD-MM
  \@result       =  An array reference passed into the sub function</pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre>
  1    =    The content of @result is trust worthy
  0    =    The $cut_date is in an unsupported format. The content of @result is crab!</pre>
