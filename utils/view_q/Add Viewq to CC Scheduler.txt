If you need to add scheduled runs of View_q and timestamper to ClearCase Scheduler, you can follow this guide.

Note - if you mess up the scheduler and tasks database, you are on your own, so let's make a backup of those before we start

Navigate to %CLEARCASEHOME%\var\scheduler\tasks
Make a copy of task_registry
Dump current schedule to a file:

cleartool schedule -get > oldshed.txt
- and copy that file too:
copy oldsched.txt backupsched.txt

Now edit task_registry, and add the following to the end of the file

#
# Praqma customized tasks...  USE Task-IDs starting at 100 !
#

Task.Begin
    Task.Id:       102
    Task.Name:     "Praqma Run View_Q"
    Task.Pathname: run_view_q.bat
Task.End

Task.Begin
    Task.Id:       103
    Task.Name:     "Praqma Run View Timestamper"
    Task.Pathname: run_view_timestamp.bat
Task.End

Note Task.Id numbers must be unique in the file. So adjust if required, and IF you needed to change the Task.Id's you you MUST adopt to that change later when adding 
the jobs to the schedule, by changing the Id's in the schedule to.

Save and close task_registry
Copy the 2 bat files in this folder to %CLEARCASEHOME%\var\scheduler\tasks


Now you can edit the file oldsched.txt, and add the following to the bottom of the file. Again like with the task_registry file, Id's must be unique, so 
this time you must watch out for unique Task.Id's as well as unique Job.Id's.
