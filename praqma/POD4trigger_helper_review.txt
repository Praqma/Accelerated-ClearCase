=head1 NAME

ACC - trigger utility module

=head1 DESCRIPTION

package: C<trigger_helper>

Module:  C<trigger_helper.pm>

The trigger_utils package contains various functions that will come in handy when you write ClearCase triggers.

it enables you to make triggers that doesn't execute if semaphores have been set, and it makes you triggers install
automatically.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To ease the use of the trigger_helper.pm module it's recommended that you keep your scripts and trigger_helper.pm
close together and include the directory that contains the trigger_utils.pm module using a relative path.

Example file structure:

 root
   triggers
   praqma
   utils

In order to use a relative path, you'll obviously need to determine the location of your running script in a pre-compiled block.

 our ($Scriptdir, $Scriptfile);BEGIN{$Scriptdir =".\\";$Scriptfile = $0; $Scriptfile =~/(.*\\)(.*)$/ &&  do{$Scriptdir=$1;$Scriptfile=$2;}}
 use lib $Scriptdir."..";
 use praqma::trigger_helper;

Finally, to utilize all the functionallity from the trigger helper you need:

 our $thelp=trigger_helper->new;          # Instantiates the trigger helper
 $thelp->enable_install(%install_params); # See more under "enable_install"
 $thelp->require_trigger_context;         # Simple check, that exits if the script is not called as a trigger
 $thelp->enable_semaphore_backdoor;       # See more under "enable_semaphore_backdoor"

When all this is in order (including the %install_params array), your trigger can be installed by calling the script (using Fully-Qualified PathName) with minimum parameters "-install" and "-vob [targetVOB]"

trigger_helper requires access to acc.pm, the ACC perl utility library, as it uses subs and constants from it!

=head2 Installing your trigger using trigger_helper

YourScriptName.pl -install -vob vob_tag [-script script_pname]
            [-trigger trigger_name] [-preview]

 -install                Required to run the script in install mode
 -vob vob_tag            The VOB where the trigger should be installed
 -script script_pname    The fully qualified path to the script (must be a
                         UNC path or a drive that is mapped).
                         If this is omitted then script pname will be the one
                         used to execute it (this too must be a fully qualified
                         path either using UNC or a mapped drive).
                         If the script pname does not exist the trigger installation
                         fails.
 -trigger trigger_name   The name of the trigger. This is only used if you wish to
                         override the triggers default name (which is already cached
                         in the script).
 -preview                Displays the cleartool command that installs the trigger,
                         but does not actually execute it. This switch allows you to
                         run the script even if you are not the VOB owner


=head2 Limitations

Trigger helper can only install triggers that are installed on VOBs!

The trigger_helper uses the scriptcall parameters, therefor it is vitally important that the trigger does not use or modify these, so they can be passed untouched to the trigger_helper.

=head1 Functionality

=head2 enable_install (%install_params)

To apply the enable_install functionality, your triggerscript needs to be called with and "-install -vob [vobname]"

 my %install_params = (
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_NAME       => 'TRIGGER_NAME',                          # string - no whitespaces
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_INSTALL    => 'INSTALL STRING',                        # string - with whitespaces
    acc::ACC_ALLOWED_VOBTYPES   => [acc::VOBTYPE_constant, 'Some_string']); # Array of constants and/or strings

=head3 acc::ACC_TRIGGER_NAME

Is the triggers or triggertypes name in ClearCase after installation.

If another trigger exists with the same name, it will be overwritten.

This can be overwritten with the "-trigger" switch

=head3 acc::ACC_TRIGGER_INSTALL

Is the installation string for the trigger, except for the "-exec" and "-c" parameter, aswell as the type-selector.

The comment will always be: "Created using the -install switch of the scriptfile: $::Scriptfile\""

The required execute string is deducted based on the script execution (which is why it must be a Fully-Qualified PathName), but can be overwritten by the "-script" switch.

The type-selector is deducted from the "-vob" parameter which is required when using trigger_helper to install the trigger and the triggername defined in the %install_params

The typical install string with consist of:

 {cleartool creation command} Only "mktrtype" is fully supported, but others with same syntax, will probably work.
 {-element | -type | -ucmobject} based on triggertype
 {-preop | -postop} {opkind} base on when the trigger is supposed to execute

=head3 acc::ACC_ALLOWED_VOBTYPES

Is an array of VOB types that the trigger is allowed to install on.

One element in the array matches one VOB type, that the trigger is allowed to install on.

Read more about predefined VOB types and custom VOB types, in the "VOB types" section.

=head3 Breakpoints and checks

When executing the enable install function, the trigger_helper check a series of parameters, to make sure that the installation is going to be valid.
The script will die with an relevant error message, if any of these checks fails.

=over

=item *

Checks if the trigger has a name

=item *

Checks if the installstring is set

=item *

Checks that the VOB parameter is used

=item *

Checks that the VOB is accessible

=item *

Checks that the executing user is VOB owner

=item *

Checks that the script path is fully qualified

=item *

Checks that the script path is accessible

=item *

Checks the VOB type and validates that the trigger is supposed to install on that particular VOB

=back

=head2 enable_semaphore_backdoor

Checks for the existence of a valid semaphore.

The semaphore enables triggers to exit silently and let the ClearCase event processed - as if the trigger had
not been executed at all.

To create a valid semaphore for a trigger script the following conditions will have to be met:

=over

=item *

A semaphore file must be created, The semaphore file must be named after the user account - no file extension (e.g lsku, g91551, ycd)

=item *

The semaphore file must be located in a subfolder of the actual trigger location named "semaphores" (defined by a constant in the module)

=item *

The semaphore file must have been created (not accessed, or updated, but CREATED) within the last 4 hours (defined by a constant in the module)

=item *

The semaphore file must contain a line stating the name of the perl script it is supposed to detronize (eg. no_rmelem_rmver.pl), the
same semaphore file can list many scritps.

=back
If a valid semaphore exist the trigger execution is canceled.

The location of the C<semaphores> directory can tweak by setting the constant C<trigger_utils::SEMAPHORE_DIR>.

Note that the semaphore files are ignored (doesn't stop the trigger) if they are more then 4 hrs old.

This setting can be tweaked by setting the constant C<trigger_utils::MAX_SEMAPHORE_FILE_AGE_DAYS>.

One hour is apx 0.042 days, thus 0.168 ~ 4 hrs.

=head2 get_versiontree_below_version( $cc_pn, \@result_array )

This function returns a version tree below a certain version. The point is that
A version tree is normally retrieved for an element, not a particular version of
an element. The function retrieves the version tree of the element and starts
shifting the version in the list until it finds the $cc_pn version - and then returns
the rest.

Parameters:

 $cc_pn                = The version to use as off-set standard version extended syntax:
                         element-pname@@branch-id
 $result_array         = The result

Returns:
  1 = Success
  0 = Some error occurred - content of @result_array is not to be trusted.

=head1 Concepts of trigger_helper

This Section will help you understand some of the concepts, that are used by trigger_helper and which are necessary to utilize the full potential of the trigger_helper

=head2 Constants

The module defines the following constants which you might consider to give different values:

C<MAX_SEMAPHORE_FILE_AGE_DAYS>        = C<0.168>

The value  of C<MAX_SEMAPHORE_FILE_AGE_DAYS> determines how long time a semaphore file is valid. The value is given
as number of days (1 hr ~ 0.042 --> 4 hrs ~ 0.168).

C<SEMAPHORE_DIR>                      = C<'./semaphores'>

The value of C<SEMAPHORE_DIR> is the relative to the script location directory where the semaphore file will be
searched for.

=head3 Imported constants

 acc::ATTYPE_ACCVOBTYPE
 acc::VOBTYPE_PVOB
 acc::VOBTYPE_ADMINVOB
 acc::VOBTYPE_UCM_CLIENT
 acc::VOBTYPE_BCC_CLIENT
 acc::ACC_TRIGGER_NAME
 acc::ACC_TRIGGER_INSTALL
 acc::ACC_ALLOWED_VOBTYPES

Are included from the ACC module

=head2 VOB types

The trigger_helper uses a set of predefined vob type and allows the use of custom VOBtype.

The concept of VOB types is deducted from ClearCase terminology, but is unique for trigger_helper and the ACC project.

Understanding the concept of vobtypes and ACCs implementation of it, is vital for the trigger installer to work as intended.

I<All constants are casesensitive, but VOB types are case insensitive>

=head3 Predefined VOB types

Any VOB can be defined as one (and only one) of the predefined types below

=head4 acc::VOBTYPE_PVOB

A PVOB (Project VOB) is defined as a VOB that is created as an UCM Project VOB.

=head4 acc::VOBTYPE_ADMINVOB

An AdminVOB is a base ClearCase VOB that acts as an AdminVOB for other VOBs, defined as it has AdminVOB Hyperlinks pointing towards it.

=head4 acc::VOBTYPE_UCM_CLIENT

An UCM_ClientVOB is a VOB that has an AdminVOB which is an PVOB_AdminVOB

=head4 acc::VOBTYPE_BCC_CLIENT

All VOB that are not defined by the above definitions, will be defined as a base ClearCase client, regardless if they are selfcontained or has an (non UCM) AdminVOB.

=head3 Custom VOB types

Custom VOB types are defined by an attribute set on the VOB in question.

The attributetype is defined by the constant acc::ATTYPE_ACCVOBTYPE

As opposed to the predefined VOB types, a VOB can have several custom VOB types, by applying several acc::ATTYPE_ACCVOBTYPE attributes to the VOB.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 General usage example

Say, you have made a trigger (\\cc_server\triggers_share\my_new_trigger.pl), that you would like to have functionallity from the trigger_helper.

First you make sure that all prerequisits listed in the synopsis, is added to your script, which would look somthing like this:

 our ($Scriptdir, $Scriptfile);BEGIN{$Scriptdir =".\\";$Scriptfile = $0; $Scriptfile =~/(.*\\)(.*)$/ &&  do{$Scriptdir=$1;$Scriptfile=$2;}}
 use lib $Scriptdir."..";
 use praqma::trigger_helper;
 my %install_params = (
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_NAME     => 'MY_NEW_TRIGGER',
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_INSTALL  => 'mktrtype -postop checkin -element -all',
    acc::ACC_ALLOWED_VOBTYPES => [acc::VOBTYPE_UCM_CLIENT, acc::VOBTYPE_BCC_CLIENT, 'myCustomVOBtype']);
 our $thelp=trigger_helper->new;
 $thelp->enable_install(%install_params);
 $thelp->require_trigger_context;
 $thelp->enable_semaphore_backdoor;

What you have done so far, is to make sure that

=over

=item *

the script can't be executed unless it is in a trigger context or is call with the -install switch

=item *

the script supports a semaphore backdoor as described in the "enable_semaphore_backdoor" section

=item *

the script supports the full extend of the -install switch and related switches.

=item *

the script can only be installed as a trigger for VOBs that are ClientVOBs (either BCC or UCM) or has an VOBtype attribute that matches "myCustomVOBtype" (case insensitivly)

=back

Now, executing the script, with the switchs "-install -vob Some_VOB" where Some_VOB specifies a valid VOB accessible for you, and a valid script path

 ratlperl \\cc_server\triggers_share\my_new_trigger.pl -install -vob Some_VOB
  or
 ratlperl my_new_trigger.pl -install -vob Some_VOB -script \\cc_server\triggers_share\my_new_trigger.pl

will try to install the script as a trigger on the said VOB with the command:

 cleartool mktrtype -postop checkin -element -all -c "Created using the -install switch of the scriptfile: my_new_trigger.pl" -exec "ratlperl \\cc_server\triggers_share\my_new_trigger.pl" MY_NEW_TRIGGER@\Some_VOB

That same command with be posted to the screen, if you run that same command with an additional -preview switch.

Note, that if any of the checks from the "Breakpoints and checks" section, failes, the script will die with the relevant error message, and neither installation nor installation preview, will work.

=head2 Defining a custom VOB type

TODO!

=head2 Constructing the %install_params array

To utilize the install helper to install the trigger, you need to create a hash in your triggerscript and call the enable_install function with it.

=head3 ACC_STOP_TWIN example

  my %install_params = (
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_NAME     => 'ACC_STOP_TWIN',
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_INSTALL  => 'mktrtype -preop lnname -element -all',
    acc::ACC_ALLOWED_VOBTYPES => [acc::VOBTYPE_UCM_CLIENT, acc::VOBTYPE_BCC_CLIENT, 'custom_vob_type']);

  our $thelp=trigger_helper->new;  # Instantiates the trigger helper
  $thelp->enable_install(%install_params);     # See more under "enable_install"

This example is taken from the acc_stop_twin.pl file and makes it so the the trigger is installed as an all element triggertype named ACC_STOP_TWIN, for "preop on lnname" execution.
On top of that, it will only allow it self to be installed on VOBs which are either UCM ClientVOB, Base ClearCase ClientVOB or of the custom vob type labelled 'custom_vob_type' (read more on "VOB types" later in this document).

=head3 ACC_NAMED_BRTYPES_ONLY example

  my %some_random_name = (
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_NAME     => 'ACC_NAMED_BRTYPES_ONLY',
    acc::ACC_TRIGGER_INSTALL  => 'mktrtype -element -all -preop mkbranch',
    acc::ACC_ALLOWED_VOBTYPES => [    acc::VOBTYPE_UCM_CLIENT,
                    acc::VOBTYPE_BCC_CLIENT,
                    acc::VOBTYPE_ADMINVOB,
                    acc::VOBTYPE_PVOB ]);

  our $triggerobj=trigger_helper->new;            # Instantiates the trigger helper
  $triggerobj->enable_install(%some_random_name); # See more under "enable_install"

This example is taken from the acc_named_brtypes_only.pl file and makes it so the the trigger is installed as an all element triggertype named ACC_NAMED_BRTYPES_ONLY, for "preop on mkbranch" execution.

Please note the slightly changed formatting and that both the install parameters hash and the trigger_helper object have changed names.
Feel free to use any name that suite your standards, as long as the trigger_helper object is working and the hash is formatted correctly and passed to the enable_install, it will work.

Also note that, since the trigger is allowed to install on all predefined VOB types, it will never need or use, custom VOB types, as every VOB will still be match by one of the predefined types.

=head2 Installing your trigger

To help you reproduce the results, all examples (except for the first one) will use the script stop_twin.pl in the example execution.
Also, all examples with stop_twin, will use the VOB called prod22 (so for reproduction purposes, you either need a VOB with that name

=head3 Generel example

 ratlperl \\CCserver\triggers\YourScriptName.pl -install -vob documents -preview

This will display the trigger install command as it would have been send til ClearCase without the -preview param, unless there is an error or exception.

The string returned should install the trigger, with the name defined in YourScriptName.pl, on the VOB "documents".

=head3 ACC_STOP_TWIN preview

 ratlperl \\CCserver\triggers\stop_twin.pl -install -vob prod22 -preview

Returns:

 Trigger install command:
 cleartool mktrtype -preop lnname -element -all -c "Created using the -install switch of the scriptfile: stop_twin.pl" -exec "ratlperl D:\myAcc\triggers\stop_twin.pl" ACC_STOP_TWIN@\prod22

Like the example above, this command shows the install string for the trigger, assuming there are no errors.

=head3 ACC_STOP_TWIN install

 ratlperl \\CCserver\triggers\stop_twin.pl -install -vob prod22

Returns:

 Created trigger type "ACC_STOP_TWIN".

This will install the trigger, using the triggerstring from the previous example

=head3 ACC_STOP_TWIN reinstall

 ratlperl \\CCserver\triggers\stop_twin.pl -install -vob prod22

Returns:

 Replaced definition of trigger type "ACC_STOP_TWIN".

If the triggername already exists on the VOB specified, the trigger_helper will automatically overwrite it.

=head3 ACC_STOP_TWIN with other triggername

 ratlperl \\CCserver\triggers\stop_twin.pl -install -vob prod22 -trigger SOME_OTHER_NAME

Returns:

 Created trigger type "SOME_OTHER_NAME".

If using the -trigger switch, you can overwrite the name specified in the trigger.

B<BE AWARE>, that this will enable you to install the same trigger twice, with different names. Use only for test and in special cases. If this becomes part of you standard installation procedures, you should change the triggername in the triggerscipt.

=head3 ACC_STOP_TWIN with other scriptpath

 ratlperl stop_twin.pl -install -vob prod22 -script \\CCserver\triggers\stop_twin.pl

Returns:

 Created trigger type "ACC_STOP_TWIN".

If using the -script switch, you can overwrite the path to the script that is the trigger.
It also enables you to exclude the FQPN from the scriptcall it self.

B<BE AWARE>, the installation string is still passed from the executing script and there is no check, that the specified script is in fact the same or even a valid trigger.
Basically, it will enable you to install any script as a trigger, using the parameters specified in the executing script
